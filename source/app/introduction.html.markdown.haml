%p Hi! :-)

  Now that you've played with the

%h3 The main page
%p
  The main page of our application is a table showing a list of ideas. Each idea has a picture, a name and a description. Each idea also has links named "Show", "Edit" and "Destroy". Below the table there's a "New Idea" link.

%h3 The idea page
The "Show" link of each idea leads to the idea page. This is how it looks:

%h3 The edit idea page
The "Edit" link of each idea leads to a page that allows you to edit the details of an existing idea.

We'll also need a page that will allow us to create a new idea and add it to the table in the main page.
