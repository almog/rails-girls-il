title: Create Idea scaffold
---


We're going to use Rails' scaffold functionality to generate a starting point that allows us to list, add, remove, edit, and view things; in our case ideas.

**Coach:** What is Rails scaffolding? (Explain the command, the model name and related database table, naming conventions, attributes and types, etc.) What are migrations and why do you need them?

<% code("sh") do %>
rails generate scaffold idea name:string description:text picture:string<% end %>
