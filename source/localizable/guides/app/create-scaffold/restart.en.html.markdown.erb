title: Restart the server

The scaffold creates new files in your project directory, but to get it to work properly we need to run a couple of other commands to update our database and restart the server.

<% code("sh") do %>rails server<% end %>


Open [http://localhost:3000/ideas](http://localhost:3000/ideas) in your browser. Click around and test what you got by running these few command-line commands.

Hit `CTRL-C` to quit the server again when you've clicked around a little.
