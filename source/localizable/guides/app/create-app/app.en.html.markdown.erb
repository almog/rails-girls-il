title: Create a Rails app

Now you want to create a new app called <code>railsgirls</code> by running:

<% code("sh") do %>rails new railsgirls -m http://railsgirls.co.il<% end %>

<code>rails new railsgirls</code> tells Rails to generate a project called railsgirls with all the files that our application needs.

<code>-m http://railsgirls.co.il</code> tells Rails to download a special template from railsgirls.co.il which makes the files a bit simpler and easier for beginners to understand.

It will take a minute or so, and after that you'll see something like this:

<%=screenshot 'app/app/create-app.png', 'windows' %>

This will create a new app in the folder <code>railsgirls</code>, so we again want to change the directory to be inside of our rails app by running:

<% code("sh") do %>cd railsgirls<% end %>

If you run <code>dir</code> inside of the directory you should see folders such as <code>app</code> and <code>config</code>. The <code>rails new</code> command automatically created all these folders and files for us.

<%=screenshot 'app/app/app-dir.png', 'windows' %>

**Coach:** Explain what each command does. What was generated? What does the server do?
