Now we'll review some of the generated folders and files and more or less understand their role in your app.

On the right side you can see a list of some of the folders and files that the <code>rails new</code> command automatically generated for us. The folders and files we're interested in today are marked in an orange rectangle.

<table style="max-width: 540px;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 30%;">Folder/file name</th>
      <th>Role</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app</code></td>
      <td>
        This is the most important folder in your app. Most of the code is there.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/assets</code></td>
      <td>
        This folder contains static files. These are files that the Rails server serves to the browser without manipulating them first. Such files can be images (they'll be placed in the <code>images</code> folder), files containing CSS code (they'll be placed in the <code>stylesheets</code> folder), or JavaScript files which we won't talk about today.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/controllers</code></td>
      <td>
        This folder contains code files that are written in the <code>ruby</code> language. Most of your app's logic (how the app works and what it does) is there. Currently your app doesn't do a lot, so all you'll see there is a little file called <code>application_controller.rb</code>. If you open this file in your text editor you'll see that it contains very little code.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/models</code></td>
      <td>
        This folder contains all your models. You still don't know what a model is, but you'll learn about it in the 4th step.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/views</code></td>
      <td>
        This folder contains all of your app's HTML code.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/db</code></td>
      <td>
        This folder contains all of the data in your app. Currently there's no data in there, but after you complete the next step it will contain all of your ideas!
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>public/index.html</code></td>
      <td>
        This file exists in your app only if you're using Rails 3. If you're using Rails 4 you won't see it (and that's fine!). This file contains the HTML code used to generate the "Welcome aboard" page you've seen earlier.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Gemfile</code></td>
      <td>
        This file contains a list of external code libraries that your app uses. In step 6 you'll learn how to use external code libraries.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
